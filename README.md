# ShapeStealther

Developed with Unreal Engine 5.5

A game about a creature escaping from a horrific laboratory.

## Work Summary from Day 4:

Luke: Pulled together an ultra-simplified version of the game. Whiteboxed a laborator layout and fixed collisions on stairs.

The resercher class (light blue) uses both of these system if you need a example
